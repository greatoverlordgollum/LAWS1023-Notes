    sort={Al-Saadoon v Secretary of State for Defence},
    description={Al-Saadoon and others were detained in Iraq by British forces; the UK Court of Appeal held that the UK was bound by the Geneva Conventions, and had a duty to ensure detainees were treated in accordance with international law, including the prohibition on torture, demonstrating that regional customary norms can be applied as international law if they meet the high threshold of stability and continuity. British forces detained Al-Saadoon and others in Iraq, prompting a challenge on their treatment. The principle established is that regional customary norms, when sufficiently stable and continuous, can be enforced as international law, obligating states to uphold international humanitarian standards such as the prohibition on torture.}

    sort={Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Case},
    description={Hungary and Czechoslovakia disagreed over a 1977 treaty for a joint dam project on the Danube; Hungary suspended work due to environmental concerns, and the ICJ held that neither impossibility nor fundamental change of circumstances justified termination, emphasizing the principle of \textit{pacta sunt servanda}. The case involved Hungary’s attempt to terminate the treaty after suspending work, countered by Czechoslovakia’s unilateral alternative. The principle reinforced is that treaties remain binding under \textit{pacta sunt servanda}, and termination based on impossibility or fundamental change of circumstances requires exceptional conditions.}

The principle established is that customary international law bars the use of force, with consistent state practice sufficing to establish customary norms.}

    sort={Whaling in the Antarctic Case},
    description={Australia challenged Japan’s JARPA II whaling program, and the ICJ held that it constituted commercial whaling, violating the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, as it was not for scientific research, and resolutions, while not binding, inform treaty interpretation. The case involved Australia’s claim that Japan’s whaling was commercial, not scientific. The principle clarified is that treaty interpretation under the VCLT considers objective program design, and non-binding resolutions can guide interpretation.}
}

% Glossary entry for ACCC v PT Garuda (No 9)

    sort={Chow Hung Ching v R},
    description={Chinese army laborers convicted of assault in Papua New Guinea, then under Australian UN mandate, claimed immunity as visiting armed forces; the High Court held that no immunity applied, as they were present as civilians, and that customary international law is a source, not a direct part, of Australian law, applicable only if consistent with domestic law.
