\section{Development, Nature and Scope of Public International Law}

\section{Sources of Public International Law}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is the document a source of public international law?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the UN
        \item Under Art 38(1) of the \statute{\textit{1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties}} (Page \pageref{ICJ Statute Art 38}), the sources of public international law are:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Treaties
            \item Custom
            \item General principles of law
            \item Judicial decisions and the teachings of publicists
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Art 38(1) is `generally regarded as a complete statement of the sources of international law' -- \case{\textit{Ure v Commonwealth} (2016) 329 ALR 452 at [15]} (Page \pageref{case:Ure v Commonwealth})
        \item Did the state consent to be bound to the jurisdiction of the ICJ/to the terms of the source?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was the source a treaty?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Under Art 38(1)(a) of the ICJ Statute, treaties are a source of international law
        \item Was the document a bilateral and/or multilateral convention between two or more states?
        \item See Topic 3 scaffolds (\ref{scaffold:Topic 3} on Page \pageref{scaffold:Topic 3}) for a detailed analysis
        \item Note that if there are a number of instances of states contravening a treaty, it is not necessary for the states to provide consistently correct conduct and that some variations in practice are acceptable, and they do not form a new rule -- \case{\textit{Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua} [1986] ICJ Rep 14}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was there international custom involved?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Under Art 38(1)(b) of the ICJ Statute, custom is a source of international law, and requires two elements:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item State practice - objective evidence that the custom is practiced widely
            \item \textit{Opinio juris} - the belief that the practice is legally required
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Unless they are persistent objectors, all states are bound to customary international law
        \item Certain customary norms are \textit{jus cogens}, which are peremptory norms from which no derogation is permitted
        \item Was there state practice?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item State practice can be evidenced by materials that demonstrate the activities and views of states and state officials
            \item State practice can generate custom if the following requirements are met: -- \case{\textit{North Sea Continental Shelf Cases} (1969) ICJ Rep 3}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The practice was consistent over time (but not necessarily entirely uniform)
                \item The practice was widespread
                \item The practice was representative of multiple states (especially those who are most likely affected by it)
                \item The practice was developed over a lengthy period of time (this is not a steadfast requriement; customary norms may still emerge rapidly if there is an overwhelming practice of it)
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Was there \textit{opinio juris}?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textit{Opinio juris} refers to the belief that the practice is legally required
            \item If there is extensive state practice, then \textit{opinio juris} tends to be less important, and vice-versa
        \end{enumerate}
        \item It is possible for treaty norms to become custom, and for treaty provisions to become customary international law -- \case{\textit{North Sea Continental Shelf Cases} (1969) ICJ Rep 3}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item However, the custom exists independently of the treaty -- \case{\textit{Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua} [1986] ICJ Rep 14}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was there regional custom involved?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The ICJ has recognised that it is possible for regional custom to exist, but invoking it requires a higher standard than general international custom -- \case{\textit{Asylum Case (Colombia v Peru)} [1950] ICJ Rep 226}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Regional custom must have a higher degree of stability and continuity to apply as international law in that area -- \case{\textit{Asylum Case (Colombia v Peru)} [1950] ICJ Rep 226}
            \item Such an example was made out in the English Court of Appeal in \case{\textit{R (app. Al-Saadoon v Sec. of Defence)} [2010] 1 All ER 271}, where rules of regional custom were found to exist, but had not met the high threshold to be invoked (Page \pageref{case:R (Al-Saadoon v Sec. of Defence)})
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If there was custom involved, was the party a persistent objector?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The doctrine of a persistent objector is fairly narrow, and enunciates that states which consistently object to the emergence of a rule from its earliest point of gestation will not be bound by it -- \case{\textit{Anglo Norwegian Fisheries Case (UK v Norway)} [1951] ICJ Rep 116}
        \item A state cannot be a persistent objector to a \textit{jus cogens} principle -- \textit{International Law Commission 2019 Report} Chapter V Conclusion 14 (Page \pageref{report:2019 ILC Conc. 14})
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was the source a general principle of international law?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Under Art 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute, general principles of law recognised by civilised nations form a source of PIL, with the objective of avoiding the \textit{non liquet} (the situation where `it is not clear' by enabling the ICJ to look at different legal systems for inspiration)
        \item General principles of international law and municipal law are included in this provision
        \item General principles of law may be implicitly adopted in judicial decisions to enable a conclusion to be made -- \case{\textit{Bay of Bengal (Bangladesh/Myanmar)} [2012] ILTOS 12}
        \item For example, various domestic legal systems were examined in relation to the issue of estoppel to aid the Tribunal in its decision -- \case{\textit{Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration (Mauritius v United Kingdom)} (2015) XXXI RIAA 359}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was there a judicial decision and/or the teachings of a publicist?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Whilst Art 38(1)(d) of the \textit{ICJ Statute} enables judicial decisions and the work of publicists to be considered as sources of PIL, they are subsidiary means for the determinations of the rules of law, and are treated as having lesser significance than other sources
        \item Decisions taken by the ICJ do not constitute binding precedent in future decisions, but remain merely persuasive -- \statute{\textit{Statute of the International Court of Justice} Art 59}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item These sources are ``resorted to by judicial tribunals not for the
            speculations of their authors concerning what the law ought to be, but for trustworthy
            evidence of what the law really is'' -- \case{\textit{The Paquete Habana} 175 US 677 (1900)}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Was this a UN General Assembly Resolution?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The UN General Assembly (UNGA) is the plenary body of the UN, and as all UN members have a seat, it has become a great forum for state practice and \textit{opinio juris}
            \item Decisions of the UNGA are not binding, except in the key areas of (without these areas, the UN could not function):
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Admission of member states
                \item Suspension of member states
                \item Matters related to the UN budget
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Resolutions of the UNGA can provide evidence for state practice
            \item UNGA resolutions can influence international law in three key ways
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Interpreting the \textit{Charter of the United Nations}
                \item Affirming recognised customary norms (through passing a resolution)
                \item Influencing the creation of new customary norms
            \end{enumerate}
            \item UNGA resolutions, whilst normally not binding, may have normative value, and can provide ``evidence important for the establishing the existence of a rule or the emergence of a \textit{opinion juris}'' -- \case{\textit{Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons} [1996] ICJ Rep 254 at [70] - [73]} (Page \pageref{case:Legality of Nuclear Weapons [1996] ICJ Rep 254}); such evidence can include:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The voting records of the UNGA
                \item Transcripts of what was said on the floor of the UNGA
                \item Margins of the votes undertaken in the UNGA
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Was this a UN Security Council Resolution?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The UN Security Council (UNSC) has limited law-making capacity, but can adopt certain binding resolutions
            \item UNSC resolutions are binding only on the members of the UN -- \statute{\textit{Charter of the United Nations} Art 25}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was there a measure of soft law involved?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Soft law refers to rules thare binding but vague, and/or `rules' that are clear but are not binding
        \item They can articulate standards/norms that will, over time, become binding, and can also be used to interpret other sources of international law
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Law of Treaties}\label{scaffold:Topic 3}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Was there a treaty involved?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ``Treaty'' means an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodies in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 2(1)(a)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 2})
        \item It has been accepted that a treaty may be written across multiple documents -- \case{\textit{Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions (Qatar v Bahrain)} (1994) ICJ Rep 112} (Page \pageref{case:Qatar v Bahrain})
        \item A unilateral declaration can be considered to have binding effect -- \case{\textit{Nuclear Test Cases (Australia v France)} (1974) ICJ Rep 253}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item ``An undertaking ... if given publically with an intent to be bound, even though not made within the context of international negotiations, is binding''
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Does the \convention{\textit{1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties} (\textit{VCLT})} apply?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Was the treaty between two or more states? -- \convention{\textit{VCLT Art 3}} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 3})
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Under Article 3, the VCLT does not influence agreements between states and other subjects or between other subjects of international law
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Was the treaty in writing? -- \convention{\textit{VCLT Art 3}} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 3})
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The VCLT applies to written treaties only, but as many of its provisions are now customary law, those provisions may still apply to non-written treaties (see Table \ref{tab:VCLT Articles that can apply as customary international law} on Page \pageref{tab:VCLT Articles that can apply as customary international law})
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Had the treaty commenced after 1980 (when the \convention{\textit{VCLT}} entered into force)?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item As the \convention{\textit{VCLT}} enterd into force in 1980, it only applies to treaties concluded after 1980, but many of its provisions can apply to treaties concluded before 1980 as provisions of general international law
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was the treaty registered with the United Nations?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A treaty must be registered with the UN in order to be used as a binding instrument in proceedings before the UN -- \convention{\textit{Charter of the United Nations} Art 102}; \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 80} (Page \pageref{convention:UN Charter Art 102})
        \item This is not a requirement for a treaty to be binding in general, but is a requirement for the treaty to be recognised before the UN
    \end{itemize}
    \item Was the treaty signed by an appropriate authority/representative?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Was the party entering into the treaty a state, an international organisation or an international entity with capacity to enter into the treaty?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Every state possesses capacity to conclude treaties -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 6} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 6})
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Has the individual representing the party produced full powers evincing their authority to enter into the treaty? -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 7(1)(a)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 2})
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item ``Full powers'' refers to a document emanating from the competent authority of a State designating a person or persons to represent the State for negotiating,adopting or authenticating the text of a treaty, for expressing the consent of the State to be bound by a treaty, or for accomplishing any other act with respect to a treaty -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 2(1)(d)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 2})
            \item Heads of State, Heads of Government and Ministers of Foreign Affairs are taken to have the capacity to conclude treaties without producing full powers -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 7(2)(a)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 2})
            \item Heads of diplomatic missions will likewise not need to produce full powers if they are accredited to adopt treaties in that area -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 7(2)(b)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 2})
            \item A representative of a state will not need to produce full powers if they have been sent to a conference/organisation with the purpose of adopting the text of a treaty at that conference/organisation -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 7(2)(c)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 2})
        \end{enumerate}
        \item If the individual has not produced full powers, is it evident from the practice of the States concerned or from other circumstances that the person is representing the State? -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 7(1)(b)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 2})
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Did the state enter into the treaty?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Signing is a two step process, entailing signature, and either ratification or acession
        \item Upon \textbf{signing} a treaty, the state expresses a willingness to continue the treaty-making process, and agrees with the treaty in principle
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item However, the state is not bound by the treaty at this point
        \end{enumerate}
        \item If the treaty is a new one, was it \textbf{ratified} by the party?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Upon ratification, the party indicates that it has consented to be bound by the treaty once it enters into force
        \end{enumerate}
        \item If the treaty is an existing one, was it \textbf{acessioned} by the party?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item This only applies if a state is becoming party to a treat that is already negoitated and signed by other states
            \item This has the same legal effect as ratification
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was the treaty in force at the time of contention?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A treaty enters into force in accordance with the relevant provisions in the treaty -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 24(1)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 24})
        \item If the treaty is silent on this point, it will enter into force when all parties have consented to being bound by it -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 24(2)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 24})
        \item If a party signs a treaty after its formation, it will be binding upon that state on the day that consent to being bound is established -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 24(3)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 24})
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Does the treaty apply to the present scenario?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The principle of \textit{pacta sunt servanda} requires that ``every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it, and must be performed by them in good faith'' -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 26} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 26})
        \item A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for failing to perform its obligations -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 27} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 27})
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item However, they may do so if the other party was aware of that law, and the law was not contrary to the treaty -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 46} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 46})
        \end{enumerate}
        \item If the treaty has been signed but not ratified/approved/accepted, a state is obliged to not undermine the spirit of the treaty, and moreover is required to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 18(a)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 18})
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The same principle also applies where a state has expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, pending the entry into force of the treaty -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 18(b)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 18})
        \end{itemize}
        \item Treaties do not impose obligations or create rights for third states in the absence of their consent (\textit{pacta tertiss nex nocent nec prosunt}) -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 34} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 34})
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was there any reservation to the treaty?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Was there a reservation or an interpretive declaration?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A reservation is a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 2(1)(d)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 2})
            \item Interpretive declarations are statements made by a state to clarify its understanding of a treaty; it does not affect the legal effect of a treaty
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Was the reservation permisible?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item By default, a reservation is permissible, unless: -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 19} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 19})
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The reservation is prohibited by the treaty -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 19(a)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 19})
                \item The treaty provides that only specified reservations may be made and the reservation in question is not in that list -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 19(b)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 19})
                \item The reservation is otherwise incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 19(c)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 19})
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Incompatibility hinges on whether it “affects an essential element of the treaty that is necessary to its general tenor, in such a way that the reservation impairs the raison d'être [the most important reason] of the treaty” -- \textit{ILC Guide to Practice on Reservations}
            \item If a reservation is impermissible:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Traditionally, this vitiates the consent of the state to the treaty as a whole and results in the state not being a party to the treaty (this is the predominant view) -- \textit{Reservations to Genocide Convention} [1951] ICJ Rep 15
                \item More recently, the offending reservation will be held void, with the state being bound without the protection of the reservation (i.e., it is cut out), unless consent is conditional on reservation, in which case they are not bound to the treaty at all
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Was the reservation accepted or objected to? -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 20} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 20})
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If a treaty expressly allows for reservations, then no acceptance of a reservtion is required by other parties -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 20(1)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 20})
            \item If a treaty has a small number of partiesand the application of the treaty in its entirety is an essential condition of signing, acceptance by all parties is required -- \convention{\textit{VCLT} Art 20(2)} (Page \pageref{VCLT Art 20})
        \end{enumerate}
        \item What is the legal effect of the reservation?
        \item Was the state a persistent objector?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Is the treaty void or otherwise invalidated?
    \item Are there grounds to terminate, withdraw or suspend the treaty?
\end{enumerate}
